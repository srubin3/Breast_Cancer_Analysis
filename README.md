# Breast Cancer Analysis
This project analyzes the **Breast Cancer Wisonsin Diagnostic Dataset** to predict whether a tumor is *benign* or *malignant* using numerical features. This project is an independent project, to determine whether numerical features can be used to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors. 

This is an independent and ongoing project that will showcase a structured analytical approach, while building a logical narrative around the data. 

My goal is to grow, improve, and refine my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, while incorporating advanced techniques beyond my Fullstack Academy training - such as Principal Component Analysis and machine learning to derive meaningful insights from this data.
